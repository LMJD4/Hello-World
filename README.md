# Hello-World
I'm literally brand new to this and Im just following the tutorial. If anyone has any suggestions or things that you think will help me out, please let me know.  
I innitally made a Github account to ask for help with installing a remote access trojan called "pupy", but unfortunately no one replied :(. So if you have any suggestions with that, please let me know. Right now I have no idea what im doing or what a GitHub is which is why im doing this tutorial so if you can help me out with that too, it would be appreciated.
